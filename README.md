# Set up and run STEMMUS-SCOPE on SURF research cloud (SRC).

This is an instruction about how to set up [SURF research cloud](https://www.surf.nl/en/surf-research-cloud-collaboration-portal-for-research) (SRC) for executing the [notebook](https://github.com/EcoExtreML/STEMMUS_SCOPE_Processing/blob/main/docs/notebooks/run_model_in_notebook.ipynb) of the STEMMUS-SCOPE model.

## Gain access to SRC
- For administrators, ask SURF for invitation
- For users trying to access the existing workspace, ask administrators to invite you.

Administrators can invite users to access the created workspace on SRC via the `SURF Research Access Management system`. To access the SURF Research Access Management system, visit [this site](https://sram.surf.nl/).

To log in to the SRC, click [here](https://portal.live.surfresearchcloud.nl/)

## Create workspace
For system administrators who want to create workspace on SURF research cloud for configuring the environment and running the STEMMUS-SCOPE model, please check [this document](./create_workspace.md).

## Setup environment
For users who want to configure the jupyter-workspace environment via conda and install `pystemmusscope`, please check [this document](./setup_environment.md).
